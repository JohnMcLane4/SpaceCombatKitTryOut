**** ADD A SHIP ****

1. Add a ship mesh to the scene and call it 'Spacefighter'.
2. Add a Vehicle component to the root transform.

**** ADD ENGINES ****

1. Add a VehicleEngines3D component to the root transform of the spaceship.

**** ADD A FLIGHT CONTROL SCRIPT ****

1. Add a new game object to the scene and call it 'Flight Controls'.

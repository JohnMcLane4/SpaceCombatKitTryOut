This scene shows you how to set up a module mount on a vehicle.

The following steps detail how to build this scene from scratch.

**** ADD A VEHICLE ****

1. Add a vehicle mesh (such as a ship) to the scene and call it 'Vehicle'.
2. Add a Vehicle component to the root transform.

**** ADD MODULE MOUNT TO THE VEHICLE ****

1. Add a new game object as a child of the vehicle and call it 'Module Mount'.
2. Add a ModuleMount component to it.
3. Drag the ModuleMount component into the 'Module Mounts' list in the inspector of the Vehicle component.
3. In the 'Module Types' list, make sure the type of module you want to load here (in this case 'GunWeapon') has been added.
4. If you want the module mount to immediately load whatever module is available at the start, check the 'Mount First Available Module At Start' box.

*** ADD A MODULE IN THE EDITOR ***

1. Create the module or drag the prefab into the scene. For this example you can drag in the provided 'EnergyProjectileWeapon_Fixed' prefab.
2. Check the 'Load Existing Child Modules' box.

*** CREATE AND LOAD A MODULE PREFAB AT THE START ***

1. Drag the provided 'EnergyProjectileWeapon_Fixed' prefab into the 'Default Module Prefabs' list.
2. Check the 'Create Default Modules At Start' box.

*** ADD A MODULE VIA CODE DURING GAMEPLAY ***

1. Instantiate the module prefab in the scene.
2. Grab its Module component using GetComponent.
3. Call the 'AddMountableModule' function on the ModuleMount component, passing the Module component, and setting the 'mountImmediately' flag to True to replace the current module with the new one.

[CODE]

public ModuleMount myModuleMount;
public Module modulePrefab;

void Start()
{
	// Create the module
	Module module = Instantiate(myModulePrefab) as Module;

	// Mount the module
	myModuleMount.AddMountableModule(module, myModulePrefab, true);
}

[/CODE]


That's all! If you would like to fire the weapon, follow the steps in the TUTORIAL_Triggerables text file, skipping the 'ADD A GUN WEAPON' and 'ADD A MISSILE WEAPON' sections.

This scene shows you how to set up firing of weapons (or any other triggerable modules) on a vehicle.

The following steps detail how to build this scene from scratch.

**** ADD A VEHICLE ****

1. Add a vehicle mesh (such as a ship) to the scene and call it 'Vehicle'.
2. Add a Vehicle component to the root transform.

**** ADD TRIGGERABLES MANAGER TO THE VEHICLE ****

1. Add a TriggerablesManager component to the root transform of the vehicle.

**** ADD A GUN WEAPON ****

1. Drag the provided 'EnergyProjectileWeapon_Fixed' prefab into the scene and position it to your liking.
2. Add the new object to the 'StartingTriggerables' list in the inspector of the TriggerablesManager component.

NOTE: Notice how the gun weapon already has a Triggerable component with the 'Default Trigger' value of 0. This is the trigger index the module will be assigned to.

**** ADD A MISSILE WEAPON ****

1. Drag the provided 'MissileWeapon' prefab into the scene and position it to your liking.
2. Add the new object to the 'StartingTriggerables' list in the inspector of the TriggerablesManager component.

NOTE: Notice how the missile weapon already has a Triggerable component with the 'Default Trigger' value of 1. This is the trigger index the module will be assigned to.

**** ADD A TRIGGERABLES CONTROL SCRIPT ****

1. Add a new game object to the scene and call it 'Triggerables Controls'.
2. Add a PlayerTriggerablesInput script to it.
3. Drag the ship (Vehicle component) into the 'Starting Vehicle field' of the PlayerTriggerablesInput script.
4. Add two entries to the 'Trigger Inputs' list in the inspector of the PlayerTriggerablesInput script.
5. Set the 'Trigger Index' of the first entry to 0 and the second entry to 1.
6. Customize the controls in the inspector.


That's all! If you run the scene, you can fire the triggerable modules with the controls you set up. 

If you want to add the weapons via Module Mounts, follow the steps in the TUTORIAL_ModuleMounts text file for instructions on how to mount modules on your vehicle.

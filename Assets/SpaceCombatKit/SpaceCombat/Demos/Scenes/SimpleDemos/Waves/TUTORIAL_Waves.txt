2. Add a PilotedVehicleSpawner component and configure the settings in the inspector.
3. Repeat until you have as many spawn points as you need.
4. Add all of these spawners to the Spawners list on the WaveController component you added above.

**** ADD MULTIPLE WAVES ****

1. Add a new gameobject to the scene and call it 'WavesController'.
2. Add a WavesController component to it.
3. Add all the WaveControllers for each of the different waves to the Wave Controllers list in the inspector.

**** SPAWN WAVES ON A TIMER ****

1. Add a Timer component to the scene and configure the inspector settings.
2. Add the Timer's StartTimer function to the On Wave Destroyed event on each of the Wave Controllers.
